# TrainingAssignmentsWithAPIManager

This directory has two Projects, one with MVC and other with MVVM.
And in both the projects, we are feching data from URL and then parsing it and converting it to the Data Model and then reloading Table view in order to reflect Data on TableView.

MVC Project
It has Model view and Controller, and one Network Layer which is API Manager.
There are test cases also written for the APIs and the coverage is 77%+


MVVM Project
It has Model view and ViewModel, and one Network Layer which is API Manager.
There are test cases also written for the APIs and the coverage is 80%.

In MVVM, one more layer is added which is View model, It differentiates how we can improve the Code coverage with the help of MVVM style of coding.
